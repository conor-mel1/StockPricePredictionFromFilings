# Stock Price Predictions from Financial Statements using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms augmented with Knowledge Graph Embeddings


The challenge of predicting individual company stock prices has been the goal of investors for decades. The stock price of a company is affected by many different factors; news, sentiment towards the company, the current political climate and the state of the economy can all have an effect on prices. As such, being able to predict prices in such a chaotic environment represents a significant challenge. However, given the rewards possible for successful prediction, many have tried to develop models, using different methodologies, to do exactly this. Much of the literature relating to the prediction of stock prices focuses on short term predictions of trends (increase or decrease in price) and price, such as the change in price within days, between days and for other periods of time less than one month. 

This project investigates the use of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Knowledge Graphs and Embeddings in uncovering the relationship between the financial performance of companies listed on US Stock Exchanges and their share price. Specifically, this work is concerned with attempting to generate price predictions from financial statements, as well as predict the trend upward or downward and the magnitude of the change of individual company stock prices between each company's annual 10K report. This report provides a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance throughout its trading year. The use of Knowledge Graph Embeddings representing non-numerical information related to each company to improve the accuracy of predictions is also investigated.

This work does not aim to provide a profitable trading framework for readers, rather it seeks to assess the effect, if any, the state of and changes to the financial filings of individual companies have on each company's share price. This in turn may provide financial decision support to investors. This work has also resulted in the production of new datasets which may be further explored by other researchers.

The repository is structred as follows:

1. The DataPreprocessing folder contains the raw data used as well as the preprocessed data used in the analysis.

2. The Graph folder contaisn visualations of the results of test conducted.

3. KnowledgeGraphs_AndEmbeddings contains all Knowledge Graph related artifacts of the project.

4. Testing contains the python code and results of tests conducted. These python scripts are presented as Jupyter notebooks
